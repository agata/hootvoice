# Changelog

## v0.2.0

The owl picked up a few new tricks. ðŸ¦‰âœ¨ Whisper transcripts can now take a quick detour through your favorite local LLM to get cleaned up, summarized, or remixed before they land in your app.

- Added an opt-in LLM post-processing engine with a local-only HTTP client, presets for formatting or summarizing, and full custom prompt support.
- Expanded Settings with a dedicated LLM tab: configure base URL/model, control auto-paste behavior, and inspect recent history saved to disk.
- Published a new `llm-postprocess` guide and refreshed the manual so you can get up and running with Ollama, LM Studio, and friends.
- Trimmed unused diff logging code to keep builds leaner.
